# convert-roman-numeral

A simple algorithm for converting roman numerals to arabic numbers.

Out of scope : Numbers greater than 1000 not supported - this would require some addition characters and multiplication. 

## USAGE : 

clone the project and run npm install (install local gulp if you don't have it globally installed)

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/pebanfield/convert-roman-numeral.git
npm install
npm install gulp

```

There is a mocha test suite that includes several use cases. So easiest to simple run it.

```bash 
gulp
```
